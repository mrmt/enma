* ENMA

  ENMA is a milter program for the domain authentication technologies.
  It authenticates sender's address with SPF and Sender ID, then
  labels the result onto the Authentication-Results: field.

  ENMA implements the following RFCs and an Internet Draft:

  - RFC4406 (Sender ID)
  - RFC4407 (PRA)
  - RFC4408 (SPF)
  - draft-kucherawy-sender-auth-header-15
    (the Authentication-Results: field)

  ENMA is developed by IIJ. IIJ has been using several domain
  authentication software, though, all of them appeared unstable. ENMA
  is designed and implemented in order to stand large ISP's operation
  and is well-tested.

* Functionality

  - SPF authentication

    Extracting a sender address from SMTP MAIL FROM. If "<>" is
    specified in SMTP MAIL FROM, it is extracted from SMTP EHLO/HELO.
    Authentication result is recorded onto the Authentication-Results:
    field. The Received-SPF: field is not used.

  - Sender ID authentication

    Extracting a sender address from a mail header with RPA.
    Authentication result is recorded onto the Authentication-Results:
    field.

  - Inserting/deleting the Authentication-Results: field

    Recording results of SPF authentication and Sender ID
    authentication onto the Authentication-Results: field. Also, to
    prevent insertion of faked Authentication-Results: fields, the
    fields which contains the hostname specified with
    authresult.identifier are deleted.
