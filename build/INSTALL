		Automatic building and installing ENMA

This document describes automatic building.

With automatic building, libbind and libmilter are compiled in a
temporary directory and linked to ENMA. libbind and libmilter are not
installed. Just enma is installed.

To install libbind and libmilter manually, please refer to
"../INSTALL.ja".

* Steps of manual building and execution

  1. Extracting

    $ tar xzf enma-x.y.z.tar.gz
    $ cd enma-x.y.z/build

  2. Moving obtained bind-9.x.x.tar.gz and sendmail.8.x.x.tar.gz

    $ mv /path/to/bind-9.x.x.tar.gz .
    $ mv /path/to/sendmail.8.x.x.tar.gz .

  3. Building

    $ ./build_all.sh --prefix=/usr/local

  4. Installing

    $ ./build_all.sh -n install
    $ sudo ./build_all.sh install

  5. Cleaning up the temporary directory

    $ ./build_all.sh clean

  6. Preparing the configuration file

    $ sudo cp ../enma/etc/enma.conf.sample /etc/enma.conf

  7. Creating the directory for the PID file

    In the sample configuration file, "/var/run/enma/enma.pid" is
    specified to "milter.pidfile". So, you need to change permission
    of the directory so that "milter.user" can write.

    $ sudo mkdir -p /var/run/enma
    $ sudo chown daemon:daemon /var/run/enma
    $ sudo chmod 700 /var/run/enma

  8. Executing

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/enma -c /etc/enma.conf

* Details of "build_all.sh"

  If you execute "build_all.sh", a temporary directory will be created
  under the "enma-x.y.z/build" directory and ENMA will be compiled.

  Usage is as follows:

    Building:
      build_all.sh [--prefix=PREFIX] [build]

      --prefix:
        Specifies an install directory of ENMA
        The default value: /usr/local

    Installing:
      build_all.sh [-n] install

      -n:
        Just displays sequence of installation commands, 
  	without executing them actually.

    Cleaning up the temporary directory:
      build_all.sh clean

  Please specify an install directory of ENMA with the "--prefix"
  option. If omitted, ENMA will be installed in the "/usr/local"
  directory.

  "build_all.sh" uses either "site.config.m4.poll-generic" or
  "site.config.m4.poll-m64" and defines SM_CONF_POLL described in
  "Notes on building ENMA for the many user environments" in
  "../INSTALL.ja".

  Build would fail if necessary commands cannot be found. Please
  modify the variables in the beginning of build_all.sh.

    MAKE_CMD:
      Specifies the GNU "make" command. "gmake" is used if
      bound. Otherwise, "make" is used.  The default value: either
      "gmake" or "make"

    TAR_CMD:
      Specifies the "tar" command which accepts the "-C" option. It
      might be installed as "gtar".
      The default value: tar

    SED_CMD:
      Specify the "sed" command, which is used to generate
      "site.config.m4".
      The default value: sed

    GROUPS_CMD:
      Specifies the "groups" command, which is used to lookup groups
      when installing "libmilter" to the temporary.
      The default value: groups

    M64_FLAG:
      Specify "1" for the 64bit environment. If specified, "libbind",
      "libmilter", and ENMA are build as 64bit binaries.
      The default value: 0

    BUILD_USER:
      Specify a user name to install "libmilter" to the temporary
      directory. If omitted, the ${USER} environment variable is
      used.
      The default value: not specified

    BUILD_GROUP: 
      Specify a group name to install "libmilter" to the temporary
      directory.  If omitted, groups are looked up wiht the ${USER}
      environment variable and the first one is used.

      The default value: not specified
